# Lecture Material 10

## Reading Guide

\[KR\] Chapter 2: Chapter introduction + Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5

- Read the following sections intensively: 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5 (excl bit-torrent, which is extensive). 
- Parts of  chapter 2.2 (HTTP) should be recognizable from earlier lectures, but this section provides a network perspective to the protocol, and less "programming" perspective
