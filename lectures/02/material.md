# Lecture Material 2

This is the mandatory reading material for this lecture:

## Reading guide:

These chapters introduce the basics of objects, arrays, and functions JS. Objects are basic building blocks in JS; they can serve as `structs`, but may also contain user defined data what works on the contained data. In contrast to C, arrays in JS are dynamic and flexible, and a rich set of notations for creating them, and operations on them is offered. **Functions plays a crucial role** in JS and in web-programming. We will need to be able to define functions, and define functions that uses functions as parameters (and produces them as return values).
