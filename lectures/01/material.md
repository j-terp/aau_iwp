# Lecture Material 1

This is the mandatory reading material for this lecture:

## Reading guide:

These chapters introduce the basic programming concepts in JavaScript (JS): Types, Values, Expressions, Variables, Statements. There are quite many pages, but the concepts should be familiar from your experience with the C-language. Pay particular attention to how values and types works in JS; string processing plays an important role in web-programming, so pay attention to the JS string processing features. If you are struggling with programming, take extra time to get acquainted with the concepts.

## Supplementary material:

There are many books that focus on the **Javascript language**. Not all are equally good, even if they are commercial (and even pricey).

- [Marijn Haverbeke: Eloquent JavaScript. 3rd edition (2018).](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html) A good free introduction to JS programming, but also become fairly convoluted.
- Axel Rauschmayer has written a number of **useful (partly free or DRM-less) books on JavaScript**, see the page [Exploring JS: JavaScript books for programmers](https://exploringjs.com/), including:
    - JavaScript for impatient programmers (ES1–ES2019), Introductory 
    - Deep JavaScript: Theory and techniques (ES1–ES2019), Advanced
    - Speaking JavaScript (ES1–ES5), Introductory, but not fully updated with newest language features.

- \[MDN\] Also has [numerous guides for JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) is another usefull web-based guide for JavaScript and front-end development
- [https://jstherightway.org/](https://jstherightway.org/) numerous other Javascript related guides. 
- [Algorithms in JavaScript](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-3988-9) **An AUB online Book using JavaScript to exemplify how to write algorithms.**
- [Introduction to new JavaScript versions](http://zorac.aub.aau.dk/login?url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4842-5394-6.pdf). Another AUB online book.
