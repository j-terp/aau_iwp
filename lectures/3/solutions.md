### Scoring rules

Single Dice:
    The score of the rounds ones, two, threes, fours, fives, sizes is computes as the number of dices times its face value, e.g. if the roll shows 5 four-dice, the score is 5*4.
Bonus:
    To earn the bonus, at least a score of 30 must be achieved in the single dice rounds combined.
One Pair:
    The dice roll must show at least two dice with identical face value.
And so on
    ...
Yatzy:
    A dice roll is Yatzy if it containts 5 identical dice. A yatzy gives a score of 50.

### Executing the Game

- HTTP:
    1. The requested url is: [https://httpbin.org/post](https://httpbin.org/post) . I.e  protocol-scheme `HTTPS`, domain `httpbin.org`, and resource path `post`. The http-method is `POST`. The fact that the resource name `post` co-insides with the `HTTP` method is an artefact of the function of the server to act as a test site. Don't confuse the two. The resource could have (better) been named `post-test`. On the other hand the `HTTP` methods is fixed by the `HTTP` protocol specification. 
    2. In a post request, the form parameters are transferred in the body. Its content type is : `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. the actual content is the string: `name=Mickey&diceCount=6&difficultyLevel=1.0&gameOrder=topDownOrder`.
    3. The response is a json (javascript serialized object notation) document: content-type "application/json"  (probably around 1352 bytes long as per the header field)
    4. The request was successful as per the status code "200".

    5. USING GET the URL is: [https://httpbin.org/get?name=Mickey&diceCount=5&difficultyLevel=1.0&gameOrder=topDownOrder](https://httpbin.org/get?name=Mickey&diceCount=5&difficultyLevel=1.0&gameOrder=topDownOrder) I.e protocol-scheme `HTTPS`, domain `httpbin.org`, and resource path `get?name=Mickey&diceCount=5&difficultyLevel=1.0&gameOrder=topDownOrder`. The http-method is `GET`. IE the form data is transferred as part of the URL in the query string. 
    6. The request has no content-type because the `GET` does not carry a body. 
    7. The response is a `json` document. 
    8. The reequest is successfull as per the status code "200"
