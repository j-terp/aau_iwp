            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p style="width: calc(100% - 160px);">The game consists of playing 15 rounds. In each round, the player makes a single roll of the chosen number of dice. Then the computer calculates the score that can be achieved with the given dice roll and round type, and registers the score in a scoreboard.</p>
